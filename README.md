# 💱 React Currency Converter

A simple React app that demonstrates the use of custom hooks, API integration, and state management through a real-time currency converter.

## 🚀 Features

- Convert between different currencies using live exchange rates
- Built with functional components and React hooks
- Demonstrates clean separation of logic using custom hooks
- Real-time updates based on user input
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔁 Custom Hooks

I learned how to create **custom hooks** in React to encapsulate reusable logic and keep components clean. This helped me understand the power of abstraction and code reuse in larger applications.

### 🔗 Combining Hooks

I explored how to use **custom hooks** alongside **built-in hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect`. This allowed me to better understand how to manage data flow and side effects in a React app.

### 🌐 API Integration

I integrated a **currency exchange API** to fetch real-time conversion rates. I learned how to:

- Make asynchronous API calls using `fetch`
- Handle loading and error states
- Update the UI based on the API response

### 🔄 Understanding the Flow

This project helped me understand the **end-to-end flow** in a React application:

1. User input triggers state change.
2. State change triggers API call.
3. API response updates state again.
4. UI re-renders with new data.
